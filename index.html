                <p>Iterative Statements, also known as loops, are used when parts of a program need to be repeated. If a section (may be a series of assignment, conditional and/ or even iterative statements) of the program will be executed repeatedly until an end condition is satisfied. To exit a loop, you must have a way of checking to see if the task has been completed. Once a loop terminates control is returned the first sentence after the loop block, that is, the subsequent code will be executed.</p>

                <p>There we go! Now back to the actual content:)</p>
                <p>There are several types of loops. The following is a list of a few such iterations:
         
	            <ol>
                    <li>For Loop</li>
                    <li>While Loop</li>
                    <li>Do-While Loop</li>
	                <li>While-Do Loop</li>
	                <li>Repeat Loop</li>
	                <li>Repeat-Until Loop</li>
	                <li>Nested For Loop</li>
                </ol>

                <p>To put it simply, an assignment statement is one which sets a value to a variable. In actuality, this value is stored in a memory location which is denoted by a variable name. As seen in figure 1.0, the number 1 is “assigned” to the variable “count”. When the program is compiled and run, the number 1 is the placed in a memory location which the variable name “count” points to.</p>

        <p>I am a 3rd year Computing student. I like computing but I have always thought that web development was not my cup of tea. However, as we delve deeper and deeper into this course, INFO2180, and what web development is about, I find that my opinion is gradually changing into a more positive one.</p>
